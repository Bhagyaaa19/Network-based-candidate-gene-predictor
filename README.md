# Network-based-candidate-gene-predictor
A Python tool for predicting candidate  protein functions within Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks. Utilizes Hishigaki and Majority Voting algorithms to forecast candidate genes for single or multiple functions. Supports network graph generation from files sourced from the STRING database. Specific to Arabidopsis thaliana taxonomy.
